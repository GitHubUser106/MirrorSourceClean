# SR&ED Time Log

**Project:** [Project Name]
**Fiscal Year:** 2025
**Method:** Human wall-clock deltas based on developer actions (git commits)

## Methodology

This log tracks eligible SR&ED time by measuring gaps between consecutive experiment commits. Time represents the developer's investigation work: reading, thinking, planning prompts, reviewing outputs, debugging, testing, and decision-making.

**Gap Protection Rule:** Any gap exceeding 4 hours is capped at 1.0 hour to prevent overclaiming during breaks, sleep, or weekends.

**What This Measures:** Developer time, not AI processing time. Claude and other AI tools serve as lab equipment—the intellectual work of hypothesis formation, result evaluation, and pivot decisions remained with the developer.

## Audit Defense Notes

This log demonstrates systematic investigation through the scientific method:

1. **Hypotheses** were formed before coding (`exp:` commits)
2. **Observations** were recorded during testing (`obs:`, `test:` commits)
3. **Conclusions** were documented (`succeed:`, `fail:`, `pivot:` commits)
4. **Time tracking** is contemporaneous (git timestamps, auto-logged)

### Evidence Chain

- **Primary source:** Git commit history (immutable, timestamped)
- **Secondary source:** This log (auto-generated from commits)
- **Narrative source:** Chat exports in Google Drive (Claude/Gemini conversations)

### AI Tool Usage Statement

AI tools (Claude, Gemini) were used as development aids analogous to lab equipment:
- Code generation and testing
- Pattern analysis and suggestions
- Documentation assistance

The developer retained responsibility for:
- Identifying technological uncertainties
- Formulating testable hypotheses
- Designing experimental approaches
- Evaluating results and deciding pivots
- Determining when objectives were achieved

This workflow is consistent with CRA's position that eligible work is defined by the nature of the investigation, not the tools used.
