## 1. UNCERTAINTY GATE (Complete Before Writing Code)

### What technological uncertainty are we investigating?
<!-- Be specific. "Can we..." or "Is it possible to..." -->


### Why can't this be solved through standard practice?
<!-- What did you Google? What StackOverflow said wouldn't work? What the docs don't cover? -->


### What is your hypothesis?
<!-- "We believe that [approach] will [outcome] because [reasoning]" -->


### What would failure look like?
<!-- Define the failure mode BEFORE you code. This is billable investigation time. -->


### Technological Domain (from config.json):
- [ ] TD-001: Cross-Domain Content Extraction
- [ ] TD-002: Dual-LLM Orchestration  
- [ ] TD-003: AI Content Detection
- [ ] NEW: _______________
